# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the Resume Tailor backend that prevent it from functioning properly in production. The backend currently has disabled core functionality, security vulnerabilities, and architectural problems that need to be resolved to support the Chrome extension effectively. This comprehensive fix will transform the backend from a prototype with mock data into a production-ready API server.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the core AI and PDF parsing functionality to work properly, so that users can actually generate tailored resumes instead of receiving mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a resume file THEN the system SHALL parse the document using PDF.js-extract with PDF.co fallback
2. WHEN document parsing is successful THEN the system SHALL extract readable text content from PDF and DOCX files
3. WHEN AI generation is requested THEN the system SHALL use Google Gemini API to generate tailored resume content
4. WHEN AI processing completes THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON with tailoredResume and coverLetter fields
5. IF document parsing fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure user data storage and authentication, so that user information and tokens are properly protected and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL use a proper database instead of JSON file storage
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens instead of using hardcoded user IDs
3. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted and follow security best practices
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and connection management
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension user, I want reliable API endpoints that handle errors gracefully, so that I get consistent responses and clear error messages when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters using express-validator
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with specific field errors
3. WHEN internal errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information while returning safe error messages to clients
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry information
5. IF API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate configuration error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension user, I want enhanced document generation capabilities, so that my generated resumes and cover letters have proper formatting and professional appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are generated THEN the system SHALL create properly formatted DOCX files with headers, sections, and styling
2. WHEN PDF files are created THEN they SHALL include proper fonts, spacing, and professional layout
3. WHEN resume content is parsed THEN the system SHALL identify and format different sections appropriately
4. WHEN cover letters are generated THEN they SHALL follow standard business letter formatting
5. IF document generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and monitoring capabilities, so that I can ensure the system works correctly and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL include comprehensive logging for all major operations
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN request/response information SHALL be logged appropriately
4. WHEN the system starts THEN health check endpoints SHALL be available for monitoring
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear startup error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Chrome extension user, I want secure payment processing and token management, so that I can purchase and use tokens reliably for resume generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payments are processed THEN the system SHALL use secure Stripe integration with proper webhook validation
2. WHEN tokens are consumed THEN the system SHALL accurately track and update user token balances
3. WHEN payment webhooks are received THEN the system SHALL verify signatures and update user accounts atomically
4. WHEN token balance is insufficient THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages with purchase options
5. IF payment processing fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without corrupting user data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment configuration and deployment setup, so that the application can be deployed securely in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use production-appropriate security settings
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL use connection pooling and proper timeout settings
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow appropriate origins while blocking unauthorized access
5. IF environment configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
