Resume Tailor - Backend ServerThis directory contains the Node.js backend for the Resume Tailor Chrome Extension. It handles all secure operations, including API calls to third-party services, payment processing, and file generation.FeaturesSecure API Proxy: Keeps all secret API keys (OpenAI, PDF.co, Stripe) safe on the server.File Parsing: Uses multer for file uploads and an integration with PDF.co to extract text from PDF/DOCX files.AI Content Generation: Communicates with OpenAI GPT-4o to generate tailored resumes and cover letters.Document Creation: Generates downloadable .docx and .pdf files from text.Payment Processing: Integrates with Stripe for a secure token purchasing system.User Management (Mock): Includes a mock database to simulate token management. For production, this should be replaced with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).Setup and Installation1. Install Dependencies:Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command in your terminal:npm install
2. Configure Environment Variables:Rename the .env.example file to .env.Open the new .env file and fill in your secret API keys from OpenAI, PDF.co, and Stripe.Important: Add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent your keys from being committed to version control.# .gitignore
node_modules
.env
3. Run the Server:For development (with automatic reloading on file changes):npm run dev
For production:npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:3000 by default.API EndpointsGET /get-token-balanceRetrieves the current user's token balance.POST /generateThe primary endpoint that orchestrates the entire document generation flow.Expects multipart/form-data with resume (file), profile (optional file), and jobDescription (text).Returns a JSON object with base64-encoded strings for the four generated files (resume/cover letter in DOCX/PDF formats).POST /create-payment-sessionCreates a Stripe checkout session and returns its ID to the client for redirection.POST /webhook-payment-successThe endpoint that Stripe calls after a successful payment to update a user's token balance. You must configure this URL in your Stripe dashboard.How to Connect the Chrome Extension FrontendIn the Chrome extension's popup.js file, update the callBackendAPI function to make a fetch request to your running server's /generate endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000/generate).Update the payment button's event listener to call your /create-payment-session endpoint and redirect to the Stripe checkout page using the returned session ID.Ensure your popup.js can handle the base64-encoded file data returned from the /generate endpoint to make them downloadable.This setup provides a complete, secure, and functional backend for your Chrome extension project.
