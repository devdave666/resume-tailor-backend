# Extension Icons

You need to add the following icon files to this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using any image editor or online tools like:

1. **Canva** - Create a 128x128 design with a resume/document icon
2. **Figma** - Design a simple icon with the ðŸ“„ emoji or document symbol
3. **Online Icon Generators** - Search for "chrome extension icon generator"

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use any square image files renamed to these dimensions. The extension will work without icons, but they're required for Chrome Web Store submission.

## Design Suggestions

- Use a document/resume icon (ðŸ“„)
- Colors: Blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) to match the extension theme
- Simple, clean design that's readable at small sizes
- Consider adding "RT" text or a small AI symbol
